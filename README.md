# **🌊 Sawall Lab / MABEE Lab**  
### *Marine Benthic Ecology & Ecophysiology Laboratory*  
**Arizona State University – Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences**

The **Sawall Lab / MABEE Lab** at ASU BIOS explores shallow-water **coral reefs** and **seagrass meadows**, integrating **physiology**, **ecology**, and **oceanography** to understand how benthic organisms and communities interact with their environment. Our research focuses on key metabolic processes—including **photosynthesis**, **respiration**, and **calcification**—in foundational species such as corals and seagrasses.

We investigate how coastal ecosystems are, and will be, affected by **climate change** by studying the adaptive strategies and limitations of benthic communities and keystone species. Our work spans both **field** and **laboratory** settings, utilizing a broad suite of methodological approaches and cutting-edge instrumentation.

## **🔬 Research Themes**

- 🪸 **Metabolic processes in foundational species**  
  Photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification in corals and seagrass.

- 🌡️ **Climate-change impacts on benthic communities**  
  Adaptive strategies, physiological limits, and ecosystem vulnerability.

- 🌍 **Organism–environment interactions**  
  Linking environmental drivers to community-level ecological responses.

- ⚖️ **Coastal biogeochemistry**  
  Redox processes, carbonate system dynamics, and hydrodynamic influences.

## **🛠️ Field & Laboratory Approaches**

Our research integrates tools and technologies deployed across **BIOS (Bermuda)** and **ASU (Tempe, Arizona)**:

### **🏝️ In-situ Field Measurements**
- Seabird **SeapHOx** sensors  
- **McLane RAS** (Remote Access Samplers)  
- **ADCP** instruments for hydrodynamics  
- Coastal sampling in coral reefs and seagrass meadows

### **🧪 Experimental & Laboratory Systems**
- Simple to high-end **in-situ and ex-situ incubation setups**  
- **PAM fluorometry** for photosynthetic performance  
- **Total alkalinity titration** systems  
- **Physiological and tissue-based analyses**  
- Controlled environmental experiments (temperature, light, pCO₂)

## **🎯 Mission**

To advance understanding of how benthic marine ecosystems function and respond to a rapidly changing climate, and to identify the physiological and ecological mechanisms that shape the resilience of coral reefs and seagrass meadows.
